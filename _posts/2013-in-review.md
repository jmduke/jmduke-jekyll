<p><strong>Shit, what a year.</strong></p>


<p>2013 has been easily the best — and most hectic — twelve months of my life thus far.  To point out the highlights:</p>


<ul>
<li>Graduated (having declared my Computer Science major less than a week beforehand)</li>
<li>Moved across the country to Seattle</li>
<li>Fallen in love with Seattle and everything that being a Seattle resident entails (more about this in a little)</li>
<li>Purchased a George Foreman Grill</li>
</ul>


<p>First, though, I’d like to share with you all the three statistics that have really summed up 2013 for me.  I’ve tracked them over the past year and I think they’re fairly illuminating of how things have gone:</p>

<p>You can easily notice some major trends coinciding with my move to Seattle:</p>


<ul>
<li>Because some critics claim that drinking Natty Light on weekdays becomes significantly less acceptable once you’re no longer in college, I’ve switched a lot of my beer consumption over to PBR.  (Thankfully, I live in Seattle, so the same cannot be said about wearing sweatpants in public.)</li>
<li>Facial hair hit a peak right before graduation, at which point I became more or less clean-shaven.  Since then, my non-beard has been in a state of constant flux punctuated by points where I just decide I look completely unacceptable.</li>
<li>And the jeans just keep on getting skinnier.  (True story, when I visited my parents for homecoming — and keep in mind this is the first time I’ve seen them in around six months — the first thing my dad says to me is <em>Oh, you wear skinny jeans now</em>.)</li>
</ul>


<p>Seriously, though, my day-to-day routine has changed so much in the span of so little time it’s almost hard to remember what life was like.  I say <em>almost</em> hard — Molly, my girlfriend, who is as beautiful as she is talented, is in her senior year now, and it’s funny to notice the parallels of our senior years: while I can’t say I miss 8a.m. classes or Swem or the unending agony of group PowerPoint presentations, it’s hard for me to believe that this time last year I was still filled with so much uncertainty about life in a new city, on a new track.</p>


<p>Thankfully, things are awesome.  A few notes about the past six months:</p>


<ul>
<li>Living alone is literally the greatest thing ever.</li>
<li>Weekend trips across the country becomes a lot less fun when you’re paying for airfare — and have to go to work Monday morning.</li>
<li>Reading and writing become much, much more satisfying when you’re not doing it for a letter grade.</li>
<li>The schedule of the real world is so much more bizarre — and taxing — than that of college.  Though I spent more time <em>doing things</em> in college — papers, clubs, problem sets, mixers, the list goes on — I feel like I spend so much more energy now.  I get home from work at 5pm and I’m mentally exhausted, deprived of the desire to work on anything else.  This is something I’m trying to get better at — I aim to write twice a week, read a book a week, yadda yadda.</li>
</ul>


<p>I’ve got some goals for 2014, too, and even though they’re pretty embarassing I’m going to share them:</p>


<ul>
<li>Bike, like, a thousand miles.  Well, literally a thousand miles.</li>
<li>Get, like, a thousand <a href="https://github.com/jmduke">GitHub stars</a>.  (Same joke here.)</li>
<li>Visit three different countries — and I just bought tickets to Iceland for the first weekend of March, so that’s only two to go.</li>
<li>Publish an iOS app.</li>
<li>Publish a book.</li>
</ul>


<p>If I accomplish even just two of those things, I’ll be thrilled; if I accomplish none of them, but 2014 turns out to be half as great as 2013 has been, I’ll be ecstatic.  What a crazy, perfect year.</p>
