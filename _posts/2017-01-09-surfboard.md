<p>Over the holidays, this tweet was making the rounds:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">When you overhear people complaining that their tools are the root cause of failure send them this video of Kelly Slater on a table. <a href="https://t.co/0Mw1CByeUy">pic.twitter.com/0Mw1CByeUy</a></p>— Jesse Hanley (@jessethanley) <a href="https://twitter.com/jessethanley/status/813904788702183425">December 28, 2016</a></blockquote>

<p>First off: watch the video!  It’s pretty neat!</p>


<p>Kelly Slater is one of the best surfers in the world.  Don’t take it from me, take it from Wikipedia:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>Robert Kelly Slater (born February 11, 1972) is an American professional surfer known for his competitive prowess and style. He has been crowned World Surf League Champion a record 11 times, including 5 consecutive titles in 1994–98. He is the youngest (at age 20) and the oldest (at age 39) to win the title. Upon winning his 5th world title in 1997, Slater passed Australian surfer Mark Richards to become the most successful champion in the history of the sport. In 2007 he also became the all-time leader in career event wins by winning the Boost Mobile Pro event at Lower Trestles near San Clemente, California.</p>

<p>He’s an impressive dude.  And he can <strong>surf on a goddamn table</strong>.</p>


<p>But here’s a compilation of him using a surfboard:</p>

<p>It’s important to be able to exist without your tools.  Sometimes it’s a necessity; sometimes it’s just for fun.</p>


<p>But there’s no substitute for having the perfect set of tools available and at your disposal; and there’s no shame in relying on them.</p>
