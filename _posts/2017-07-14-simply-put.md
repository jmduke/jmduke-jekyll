<p>Chris Eidhof tweeted a <a href="https://twitter.com/chriseidhof/status/885414319231512576">good thing</a>:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">The word 'simply' can often create a huge distance between the author and the reader (when the reader doesn't understand straight away).</p>— Chris Eidhof (@chriseidhof) <a href="https://twitter.com/chriseidhof/status/885414319231512576">July 13, 2017</a></blockquote>

<p>One of the replies to the tweet was <a href="https://twitter.com/simjp/status/885604763160592385">also very good</a>:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">I’ve found that I’m personally <em>tempted</em> to use the words “simply” or “basically” when I don’t know how to actually explain something 😅</p>— JP Simard (@simjp) <a href="https://twitter.com/simjp/status/885604763160592385">July 13, 2017</a></blockquote>

<p>This reminds me of a lesson learned back when I was an English major <sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>


<p>I’d turn in papers filled littered with <em>clearly</em> and <em>obviously</em> binding a piece of evidence and a conclusion, like:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>Obviously, Shelley’s ending for the Creature — like much of the action prior — mirrors the fall of Satan as depicted by Milton.  The passage by which Viktor remarks, “the fallen angel becomes a malignant devil”, is an homage to <em>Paradise Lost</em> (and clearly, by extension, the greater English canon, and the way by which author’s literary creations assume lives of their own, for good or for ill.)</p>
</blockquote>


<p>Each time I did that, my professor would correctly point out:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>We use words like “obviously” to point out things that are not necessarily obvious; we use words like “clearly” in absence of a better way to provide clarity.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>Those little bridge words don’t just belittle (and, on occasion, befuddle) your reader: they are bad prose and betray your lack of mastery of a subject.  The next time you find yourself writing “simply”, ask yourself: is it that simple?  Or are you just trying to will simplicity into existence?</p>
