title: Blog 7.0
---

It's that time of year, when young mens' heads turn to thoughts of redesigning their websites.

I have been meaning to write more.  A couple things have stopped me from doing so:

1. Lack of habit.
2. I have been writing more on iPad lately, which makes publishing difficult.
3. I didn't like the look of my blog.

And I'd been meaning to take a crack at a redesign anyway!  I had some general goals:

1. About-first site, rather than a feed-first site.  (I don't blog with enough quality, consistency, or rapidity to justify having the index page be a feed.)
2. Have some way I can write, edit, and publish on my iPad, where I am trying to do more writing.
3. Preferably not use Hugo.  Hugo is very cool and very fast but I hate using it and it adds a tremendous amount of friction to doing things.
4. Not pay money.  I am spending too much on personal software as-is.

I don't know how many times I've done this song and dance — perhaps dozens, as it's just so dang _fun_ — but "7.0" has a nice touch to it.  So here's Blog 7.0: built with Jekyll, Git, Netlify, and Netlify CMS.

I still need to do some tweaks (lists, code formatting, backporting old posts) and some general shenanigans.  But this is what it's going to look like.
