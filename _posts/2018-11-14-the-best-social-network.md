title: The best social network
---
A couple weeks ago my friend Rosh introduced me to the greatest social network ever, which is the Apple Watch Activity Sharing mechanism.



It is terrific: quiet, benign, and universally pleasant.  It is, I imagine, what most people get out of Instagram.  It consistently entirely of you getting push notifications when someone you know finishes a workout or closes their rings, and you optionally sending a reply.



The replies, by the way, are incredibly silly and cheesy:

There's a banality to them that crosses over into irony, but it's so \*fun\*.  There is literally nothing negative or challenging about my enrollment in this little lattice society of Apple Watch wearers; I go for a morning run, I get some texts saying "Yeehaw! ðŸ¤ " or "Missed the bus? ðŸ’ª", and I smile.



It feels nice.  Twitter doesn't feel nice [^1]; Facebook doesn't feel nice.  Apple Watch friends feel nice.
