Okay, this is a *terrible* list of things.  I like GraphQL!  I like Web Assembly!  I... think web components are neat!  But if you want to maximize the probability you are an employed software developer in 2028, learning GraphQL is a bad idea.  

I mean, it‚Äôs a better idea than like, learning Angular.  But valuable skills are [Lindy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindy_effect) goods; the trick is not to identify ones that are just about to come into vogue but the ones so prevalent that they‚Äôve transcended fashion.  At an object-level perspective (which I think is dumb: you should not be emphasizing technologies over architecture!), that would be C++ or build systems.

But at a non-object level perspective, every software developer needs to:

1. Communicate extremely well to technical and non-technical colleagues
2. Pattern match

That‚Äôs it!  *Those* are the two most valuable skills and the ones least likely to be automated out of existence.  Take a writing class and start doing crosswords.

(Alternatively, you could just learn COBOL.  There is a small and insanely profitable market for COBOL engineers and it is one that presumably will not die for another generation or two.)
