title: Forty hours
---
Elon did a tweet thing last week (this week? It's hard to tell, with the whirlwind autumn-winter border) about "nobody changing the world working forty hours a week."  

This provoked the usual flares â€” one side saying "hustle ðŸ’ª grind ðŸ˜¤ never ðŸ’ª sleep ðŸ˜¤" and the other saying "if you work more than forty hours a week you are a monster". [^1]

I think this is a particularly poor discussion to have on Twitter.  Here are things that I think to be all true and non-contradictory:

1. The most successful people I read about profess to work very long hours.  (I'm thinking startup-y folks, folks I read in history books, etc.)
2. The most successful people I know in real life work forty hours a week.
3. I work around 40-45 hours a week.
4. I think I would be miserable in a job where it was expected of me to work, say, sixty hours a week.
5. And yet I spend another ~15 hours a week doing work-ish stuff: freelancing, side projects, reading about technology, engaging in the zeitgeist.
6. I credit that extra time to getting me to where I am today â€” which is not to say I'm particularly talented or accomplished, but it got me where I am.
7. I can spend that extra time because I'm single, childless, affluent, and have spent every moment of my life near a computer and a working internet connection.
8. I don't think I would have any meaningful drop in net productivity if I worked thirty hours a week.
9. I don't think I would have any meaningful boost in net productivity if I worked fifty hours a week.
10. Everyone's work ethic and work style is different, and judging 'productivity' based on 'time spent in the office' is insane.

It's just kind of a weird conversation to watch play out over and over again.  I joke a lot about having a Puritan work ethic, and I mean it â€” for better or for worse, I consider my best days to be the ones with productive outputs â€” but it's hard to project that any further than what makes me tick.

(Also, hustle mindset is terrible. Getting an extra two hours sleep will _always_ improve my total sanity _and_ productivity more than spending an extra two hours at the office.)

[^1]: Obviously nobody said these things exactly or with such uncharitable aims.  But you get my point.
