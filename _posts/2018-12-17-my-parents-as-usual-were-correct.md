title: 'My parents, as usual, were correct'
---
All of the things I've 'learned' in the past two years or so about being a better and healthier person are things I rejected when I was an insolent teen:

1. Eight hours of sleep a night.
2. No screens before bed.
3. Stay hydrated.
4. Eat lots of vegetables.
5. Don't try and do too many things at once.
6. Get out of the house.

I find myself wondering what other seemingly obvious stuff my parents tried to teach me in 2019 I will come around to, ten years too late.  (Probably something   to do with spending too much money.  Or about washing my hands.)
