title: What surprised me about New York
---
- I did not realize the city was so large.  Brooklyn alone is the size of seattle.  I knew the boroughs were a thing, but I figured they were just big neighborhoods, not entities unto themselves.
- There was trash everywhere. like, _everywhere_.  which is not to say it was dirty, but just that there were so many bags of trash.
- So many Canada Goose jackets.
- So many dogs.
- So many Canada Goose jackets on dogs.
- Everyone, and I mean everyone, was extremely lovely and kind. 
- An order of magnitude more diversity than any city in which I've lived.
- The subway's weird turnstile-claw-revolving-door things are dystopian.
- Park Ave. is breathtaking; so is East Village.  You look into each little brownstone and a part of you wants to stay there forever.
- Everything is a little bit louder than it should be.
- I miss it already! I miss it so much.
