title: Buttondown's free plan
---
I've been thinking about Buttondown's pricing model a lot lately, and one way in which I am thinking about it is: "was it a mistake to offer a free tier?"

Popular wisdom says yes. Take the inimitable patio11:

Or [Baremetrics](https://baremetrics.com/blog/freemium-saas-implode):

> The bigger issues came down to the fact that our resources are finite. We’d been able to scale our infrastructure slowly because our growth before had been predictable and we could figure out ahead of time when certain bottlenecks would become major issues.

> The free plan threw all of that out the window, though.

> When your available resources, whether it be team size, performance caps or money, are tight, then “free” has a real possibility of causing more damage than providing any real benefit.

As for Buttondown...

The actual _technical_ costs of running a free tier are fairly minimal; I would like to crunch the numbers but, handwavy-wise, I'd say around 20% of the emails sent and subscribers gained are on free-tier accounts, which seems like a reasonable amount given that the funnel of "active but free user" to "paid user" is pretty healthy — a lot of my paid accounts have come through the blessed path of:

1. Started on Buttondown as a free user with a trivial number of subscribers
2. Gained subscribers and hit >1K
3. Happily started paying and are now a profitable customer. (Buttondown's business model is such that if you have 1,000 subscribers and are paying the bare minimum, so long as you're not literally sending an email every day I have a decent margin on you.)

So the free tier is 1) not directly costing me money and 2) working as a good upsell opportunity.  Sounds great!  Where it _really_ hits me, though, is customer support burden — again, I don't have exact numbers here, but I would peg 80% of customer service burden on free users. (This is one lesson that I had read online but never really internalized: the folks who are willing to spend money on a service are, paradoxically, less persnickety about the service itself.)

Just because of the way I am — I want to help everyone using Buttondown! — I try to not really care about this.  Folks are folks, and if you have a reasonable request or suggestion I am going to try and address it. This has grown unsustainable, though: there are too many users that the weeks I spend addressing every single thing are weeks that I end up treading water and not actually making progress on the product.

It is very tempting to snap my fingers and remove the base plan with a $5/month one — less as a way to get profit from the free users and more as a way to make folks prove that they are 'serious'.  But I like Buttondown having a free tier; it seems innately 'good' to me, even if it's not the right business decision, if that makes sense.

Buttondown isn't a "business".  It's making a non-trivial amount of money, sure, but the fact that it is a side project with no aspirations for it to be more than a side project means that I can be more incentivized by what feels 'correct' than what is materially most profitable.

And so, I've kinda arrived at this concept of a free tier being a bad choice that I don't regret.  Or rather, it's a bad choice from a _business_ perspective, if not from a personal one.

[^1]: This is something I'm actively working on getting better at: if you're a free customer of Buttondown I will probably not prioritize your feature request unless it's something already on my roadmap.
