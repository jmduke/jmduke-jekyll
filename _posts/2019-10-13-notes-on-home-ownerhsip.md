I have owned a house for just shy of two months now.  The two months have been blurred and boisterous — something like a movie's depiction of a wild night out, all motion blur and jump cut (Ikea trips and cold-pressed juice taking the place of strip clubs and tequila).  

A friend asked me the other day what's surprised me of the change, and I don't think there was anything pithy I could answer: a lot of things have changed, a lot of things haven't.  I'll be using this page to write down some notes.

- I am very, very lucky.
- The first month was really exciting and, in retrospect, really tough.  I am a creature of habit who has an annoying LinkedIn-core approach to my morning routine [^1] — I know myself well enough to know that I find peace and strength in having certain parts of my life be pillars, and the chaos of moving to a new neighborhood and dealing with all of this (imagine me gesturing wildly here) *stuff* was really tough.  I stopped working out because I couldn't find a nearby gym (or time to use one); I stopped working on the projects that gave me joy (because doing House Stuff always felt more urgent); I started drinking more, because a few cocktails were the most reliable way to conquer a stressful day.
- Motivation to do House Stuff drops precipitously after everything is settled in the right room.  There are days where I look at the (uninstalled) light fixture in the guest room or the unhung TV propped against the living room mantle and consider betting against myself that certain things will *never* get done.  It's a certain variety of the [80/20 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle) — I'm able to get 80% of comfort from the small tasks, making it much less appealing to deal with the backlog on the proverbial [^2] JIRA board.
- The moments I feel at my most [science dog](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/ac/58/68/ac58680265d0328a91bfb3f8c1052a6d.jpg) are the mundane ones: figuring out when I'm supposed to put out the recycling, dealing with my first wolf spider, trying to find a local whippersnapper to mow my lawn. [^3]
- I understand what everyone was so excited about Costco for.  The unit economics are a lot more attractive when "ehh, we'll throw it in the basement" is a conceivable answer to any sort of storage-oriented question.
- I miss the ten-minute walk to work, but biking is actually a very nice bookend for the day: brisk and bracing in the mornings, cathartic in the evenings.  (Stay tuned to see if I am still so rhapsodic come December.)
- There are certain parts of this enterprise that seem as if they will never lose their magic: being able to walk directly outside to a fenced backyard with a Weber grill whenever I please; being able to paint and drill and transform a space on a whim.  I have a coworker whose sole hobby is home improvement stuff, and I never quite understood it before; it turns out that the power of transformation, of turning sweat and time and wood into progress, is primordial and intoxicating.
- It turns out houses can just be, like, _slanted_, and that's a normal thing.
- Also my steps to the front porch don't have rails and are now in a sort of Schrödinger's cat situation because no contractor can legally work on them without also adding rails. [^4]
- I am very, very lucky.

(More to come.)

[^1]: This is much to the consternation of my partner, whom I love for tolerating me in _many_ respects but particularly for letting me ply her out of bed at six in the morning with promises of coffee and a crosword.
[^2]: I haven't reached "created a JIRA for my house" levels of obnoxious, I promise.
[^3]: Typing the phrase "mow my lawn" is, for instance, a moment that seems so simultaneously quixotic and surreal. 
[^4]: One has, however, generously suggested that they can guide me on what materials to buy and advise me on how to work on the stairs while working on a different project, which of course is very chill and legal.
