title: Instances of luck
---
i have had many instances of tremendous luck in my life and i would like to try documenting them as well as possible. more to come; this is a living document.

- was born into my family
- when my bike was stolen the thief actually _got caught_ and _the bike was returned_ which almost never happens for bike thefts in seattle
