title: Instances of luck
---
i have had many instances of tremendous luck in my life and i would like to try documenting them as well as possible. more to come; this is a living document.

- was born into my family
- when my bike was stolen the thief actually _got caught_ and _the bike was returned_ which almost never happens for bike thefts in seattle
- when i flew to paris in early 2019 they offered me FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS to take a flight that was a mere hour later
- my brother was very big into PHP / IRC / coding stuff when I was a mere lad, which meant that i absorbed a lot of web design stuff through osmosis
