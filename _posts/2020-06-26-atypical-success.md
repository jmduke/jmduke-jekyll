title: The luxury of atypical success
---

I have been [chatting with folks](https://overcast.fm/+cc504yPrk) quite a bit lately about side projects.

A theme that keeps coming up that I don't think is particularly obvious is that both of my successful projects spent a long time being not particularly successful.

Neither Buttondown nor Spoonbill had particularly meteoric launches.  Both sported around a hundred signups in their first week; Buttondown had a grand total of, if I recall correctly, _two_ paying users for the first month or so, whereas Spoonbill spent *three years* without a single paying customer (and, to be clear, this was because I didn't offer paid functionality.)

This is perfectly fine.  They were still successful by my metrics at the time: they were tools that I liked and were proud of; I learned something from having built them. 

Most importantly, though, they were *cheap to maintain*.  I was not hedging my livelihood on their success; I did not have investors who were requiring exponential growth.  I could afford (morally and financially) to let them sit and grow slowly, collecting new users and functionality like a stone collects moss.

Scoping something as a small project lends you two powerful advantages in this vein:

- You can pick and choose target markets whose size would otherwise be prohibitively small.  "Metadata sync engine between Etsy and Mailchimp" is the genre of business that has a total addressable market size insufficient to sustain a business of a handful of employees, but it's certainly large enough to pay for your groceries every month.
- You can play the long game.  "We are going to sit and collect DNS registration data for four years" is a difficult prospectus when you need to figure out where rent is coming from next month: it is trivial when you are looking for a way to spend a few evenings every month.  [^1]

If you are going to find a project, I encourage you to find something particularly small and particularly *durable* (which is to say, does not require constant or near-constant attention), so that you give yourself the ability to take a break from the project for weeks or months while it accumulates interest.

[^1]: Speaking personally, one of the things I was dismayed about when launching Buttondown was how many similar projects were getting spun up that received press traction whereas I was marooned in the tar pits of word-of-mouth growth.  I delight in the fact that the three other tools in my cohort of "email projects that launched in 2017" have all since shut down or pivoted entirely.
