title: Words I have learned
---
When I was in high school and even more insufferable than I am now, a friend and I started a tumblr called "sun words".  The concept of this was to collect words that we discovered that were particularly succulent or mellifluous. [^1]

I have found myself learning more and more words recently.  This is fun and good: I was worried for a while that my days of adapting and playing with the English language were largely behind me.  I thought it would be interesting and illustrative to collect a list of the words I've learned recently alongside the sources from which I've gleaned them. (I expect the majority to be from the NYT crossword, which I recommend you start doing.)

| word          | definition                                        | source        |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| calf          | a floating piece of ice detached from an iceberg. | NYT crossword |
| piste         | a ski run of compacted snow.                      | coworker      |
| autochthonous | native to the place where found (ant. allochthonous) | twitter
| polity | an organized society; a state as a political entity | *Against the Grain*
| besserwisser | know-it-all, wiseguy, wiseacre, smart aleck | @schlagetown
| olio | a miscellaneous collection of things | NYT crossword
| eunoia | beautiful thinking | @schlagetown
| amphigory | nonsense verse | @schlagetown
| enchiridion | carried reference book | @schlagetown
| phrontistery | a place for studying | @schlagetown
| apothegm | short, witty aphorism | @schlagetown
| selcouth | strange; unfamiliar; marvelous | @schlagetown

[^1]: Why "sun words"? Because we were high schoolers, and because we learned of the concept of "SAT words" — words that made Flesch-Kincaid salivate — and because _Sun_day comes after _Sat_urday.  (I told you — insufferable.)
