title: One week off

I took this week off!

It would be a lie to say that I didn't half-plan, half-expect my "week off" to
be spent roughly as productive/engaged as my weeks on. "It's really not about the
work itself," I found myself telling myself (and others). "I honestly think what
I really want is five days to sleep in, make breakfast, go for a nice walk, and then
spend four or five hours in flow."

I planned on writing a good amount, too, and catching up on some reading — really spending
the time intentionally. Days without agendas and calendar events are gifts, after all, and I
wanted to take full advantage.

I didn't do any of this, of course.  It would be a lie to say that I heeded the counsel of
my partner (who told me to ban myself from the office); it would be a lie to say that I 
decided to be judicious and give myself a little bit of digital detox, as a treat, to try
and recalibrate.

The truth is more boring: I could barely muster the energy to do anything at all.
I didn't realize how much I needed a break! I've slept around nine hours each night;
I've played Switch until around 10am, logged some _particularly_ half-assed workouts,
had a bottle of *La Fin Du Monde*, and ignored my phone and the wider world with the exception
of checking my work inboxes [^1] every morning. [^2]

It's Friday afternoon, and I've been pretty happy this week. I puttered around with some home cleaning;
I messed around a bit with my personal web page, like adding a list of "current media" to the home page
and worked on [content detail pages](https://jmduke.com/content/sister-outsider/) a bit; I've spent maybe
three hours total of brainwaves on Buttondown.

"Pretty happy", I emphasize. I have never been a huge vacation person, and this feels less gratifying as it feels
_necessary_ — a bit of mental rehab that I wasn't quite aware I needed. 

It will not surprise you that on today, the last day of my sojourn, I am getting a bit antsy.  I have dutifully
resisted the urge to check Work Slack, which at the time of this writing is sitting at 54 notifications, but 
my patience is wearing thin. I am starting to plan about the next workstream for internationalization in Buttondown,
but even now — after four days of rest and unproductive redoubt — I can't quite muster the energy for it.

I didn't realize how much I craved a bit of brain-lamination time until I seized it, and I recommend doing the same.

[^1]: One downside of running two side businesse    s is that you cannot exactly take a week off from answering emails.

[^2]: "Be sure to add that your beautiful and utterly talented partner made you beef bolognese", my partner added as she read this paragraph. It's true: [the recipe](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1015181-marcella-hazans-bolognese-sauce) was delicious.
