I've spent the past few weeks tinkering with my personal site.

I want my personal site to be the place where I can think out loud and iterate: 
I have largely abandoned the process of "publication" where I spend a month
writing a post and iterating on it and then I hit send and it is done and I move
onto other things.  (I think that is a valuable craft, but I prefer to do it 
in [newsletter form](https://buttondown.email/letters-to-j).)

The pieces of writing that I'm getting most excited about lately are things that
evolve over time.  Some of these are definitionally dynamic, like my [post of words](/2020/07/21/words-i-have-learned).

Some are just situationally dynamic: I think the content of them will evolve over time.
This post, I think, will be one of them: I will keep on adding to it as I change my site.

I am thinking a lot lately about the phrase "incrementally correct personal websites", as 
coined by [Brian Lovin](https://brianlovin.com/overthought/incrementally-correct-personal-websites) via
Guillermo Rauch.  Brian's takeaway is to order posts by last updated date rather than creation date,
which is good — I plan on borrowing that!

But an even stronger manifestation of this concept is [Gwern](https://www.gwern.net/About)'s use of _duration_
as a metric, rather than timestamp, which I think is even more accurate: most pieces of writing have a series
of time associated with them rather than one or two or three timestamps. 

I also enjoy Gwern's use of "status" here: a piece can be finished or unfinished or ongoing or anything, really:

> The “status” tag describes the state of completion: whether it’s a pile of links & snippets & “notes”, or whether it is a “draft” which at least has some structure and conveys a coherent thesis, or it’s a well-developed draft which could be described as “in progress”, and finally when a page is done—in lieu of additional material turning up—it is simply “finished”.

I think there's a concept of reification here that's important! There's a sense of evolving a thought from idle distraction to snippet to half-baked thought to draft to final piece:
I have historically thought of a site as a thing that captures only the last stage but now I am interested in creating a software for handling all phases well.

## The oppressive atomicity of the "post"

One issue of this approach is that a lot of infrastructure (newsletters, RSS, etc.) is set up to think of the "post" as the primary unit: you have a linked list of content, each item in that linked list has a single version, and that's your site.  It's non-trivial to publish changes to a given "post", especially if you want to dramatically change metadata (like a post title or overall structure, that sort of thing.)

There are some interesting approaches to this problem.

[Paul Stamatiou](https://paulstamatiou.com/stuff-i-use/) publishes individual RSS feeds for long-running posts.  I've adopted this approach for things like [the words that I have learned](https://jmduke.com/2020/07/21/words-i-have-learned).  Paul also emphasizes the "Updated" date rather than the "Published" one

[Andy Matuschak](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes) publishes items as "notes" rather than posts.  This approach is more dramatic: it completely eschews indices or feeds in favor of being a DAG of items that, like hyperlinked index cards, can be referenced and popped off the stack as need be.  

Andy also has a bunch of writing that _doesn't_ fit into this system, as documented on his [primary site](*https://blog.andymatuschak.org/post/159340765257/exalting-data-missing-meaning.)
