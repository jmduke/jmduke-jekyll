title: Personal site as clay

![](/img/reify.png)

I've spent the past few weeks tinkering with my personal site.

I want my personal site to be the place where I can think out loud and iterate: 
I have largely abandoned the process of "publication" where I spend a month
writing a post and iterating on it and then I hit send and it is done and I move
onto other things.  (I think that is a valuable craft, but I prefer to do it 
in [newsletter form](https://buttondown.email/letters-to-j).)

The pieces of writing that I'm getting most excited about lately are things that
evolve over time.  Some of these are definitionally dynamic, like my [post of words](/2020/07/21/words-i-have-learned).

Some are just situationally dynamic: I think the content of them will evolve over time.
This post, I think, will be one of them: I will keep on adding to it as I change my site.

I am thinking a lot lately about the phrase "incrementally correct personal websites", as 
coined by [Brian Lovin](https://brianlovin.com/overthought/incrementally-correct-personal-websites) via
Guillermo Rauch.  Brian's takeaway is to order posts by last updated date rather than creation date,
which is good — I plan on borrowing that!

But an even stronger manifestation of this concept is [Gwern](https://www.gwern.net/About)'s use of _duration_
as a metric, rather than timestamp, which I think is even more accurate: most pieces of writing have a series
of time associated with them rather than one or two or three timestamps. 

I also enjoy Gwern's use of "status" here: a piece can be finished or unfinished or ongoing or anything, really:

> The “status” tag describes the state of completion: whether it’s a pile of links & snippets & “notes”, or whether it is a “draft” which at least has some structure and conveys a coherent thesis, or it’s a well-developed draft which could be described as “in progress”, and finally when a page is done—in lieu of additional material turning up—it is simply “finished”.

I think there's a concept of reification here that's important! There's a sense of evolving a thought from idle distraction to snippet to half-baked thought to draft to final piece:
I have historically thought of a site as a thing that captures only the last stage but now I am interested in creating a software for handling all phases well.

Some other things I want to address:

1. Capturing things to think about (the left-hand side of the image) is a completely different process than
reifying them into useful and digestible thoughts or arguments!
2. One big unsolved problem: RSS and many other things are built around the atomicity of the post.
