title: Notes on the Echo Loop
---
- It is surprisingly difficult to press the little button. Maybe I'll get better at it: I'm boasting like a 40% success rate with an n=5 right now.
- ...Wait, this thing doesn't work with AirPods? It doesn't relay audio out to whatever's connected to the phone even though it's using the phone as the main device? Are you _serious_?
- I have had this device for five days and used it exactly twice. I can't remember the last time I was this unenthused about a toy.
