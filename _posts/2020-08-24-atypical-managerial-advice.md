title: Atypical managerial advice
---
I'm starting to learn more about what the transition from individual contributorship to the manager's life looks like, and I'm reading a lot and talking to a lot of people. A lot of advice and resources seem very fluffy and same-y: "empathy good, growth good", etc.

I wanted to have a space to capture some interesting things that legitimately changed my perspective. Here is that space!

- One thing you have to tamp down on is how you deploy your own opinion. As an individual contributor, you're rewarded and incentivized to be loud and you're contributing as an IC in the marketplace of ideas. As a manager, the power structure is very different: if you disagree with an engineer on your team about how to implement or architect something, it's not a debate over what is good and what is bad: it is an employee and an employer at odds with one another.
