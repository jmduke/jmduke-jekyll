<p>Last week was a long week.</p>


<p>I hesitate to call it a <em>bad</em> week.</p>


<p>I’ve had bad weeks, and this wasn’t one of them:</p>


<ul>
<li>Bad weeks are the weeks when you get bad news about a family member.</li>
<li>Bad weeks are the weeks when you don’t know where you’re living the following Tuesday.</li>
<li>Bad weeks are the weeks where literally nothing happens as it should, up to and including your hot water connection in the middle of February during a cold snap.</li>
</ul>


<p>That’s not what this was.  This was just a long week.  Here are some things that happened during this long week:</p>


<ul>
<li>I ran into a wall at work, stymying my progress.</li>
<li>I picked up a new client for my <a href="http://villageblacksmith.consulting">small consulting practice</a>, which was really exciting but still mentally taxing.</li>
<li>A half-abandoned side project suddenly picked up a bunch of steam.  Again, this was super exciting but it reminded me that I needed to do a bunch of small things around it (setting up proper monitoring; improving the onboarding flow; etc.) that required a lot of mental effort.</li>
<li>Overall, I felt sluggish and just <em>behind</em>.</li>
</ul>


<p>None of these things are really too out of the ordinary.  None of these things are individually taxing, but the combination of them all sucked.</p>


<p>I like days that are fairly rote and frictionless, and when that stops happening I get stressed.</p>


<h2 id="being-productive-is-literally-the-only-thing-that-matters-in-life-a-primer">Being productive is literally the only thing that matters in life: a primer</h2>


<p>People deal with stress in different ways: some avoid work, some overeat or overdrink, some just ignore it.  I am the breed of person who responds to stress by collapsing myself into work: if having too much to do is the problem, my brain convinces itself that the solution is <strong>doing as many things as humanly possible.</strong> <sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>


<p>I know exactly what levers I need to pull to make myself super productive:</p>


<ol>
<li>Close out of Slack, Twitter, and anything that might grab my attention.</li>
<li>Remain as static and comfortable as possible: this means sweatpants, headphones, and a fairly gross pair of slippers.</li>
<li>Eat whatever is frictionless.  Sometimes this means protein bars and a very unadvisable amount of Diet Coke. Sometimes this means cheese sticks and La Croix.  Literally whatever is closest and doesn’t require mental effort to consume.</li>
<li>Listen to the same handful of albums on repeat. <sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></li>
</ol>


<p>Basically, I try to remove all variables except for whatever I’m working on.  This is a generally successful technique in that I end up being very productive.</p>


<p><strong>This is super unsustainable.</strong>  The levers I pull to make myself productive have pretty obvious costs: I sleep worse, I don’t work out, I eat (and drink, because the only way I can unwind easily is with a drink or two) poorly.</p>


<p>But the non-obvious costs are just as bad: I become irritable and snappy.  I lose my patience.  I feel mentally and physically fatigued.</p>


<p>But hey, I’m productive, right?  I got done what needs to be done.</p>


<h2 id="how-to-actually-spend-a-weekend-without-looking-at-your-laptop-or-at-least-a-friday-night-because-who-are-you-kidding-you-re-still-a-workaholic">How to actually spend a weekend without looking at your laptop (or at least a Friday night, because who are you kidding you’re still a workaholic)</h2>


<p>So, flash forward a bit.  It’s Friday evening; I’ve finished up my last bit of work for the week.  I accomplished a lot, which is good!</p>


<p>But I’m still stuck in a mindset where I <em>need to do more</em>.  I was frustrated with myself for wasting so much time at work without figuring out a solution, so I needed to make up for that ‘lost’ time by being even more productive.</p>


<p>I start writing down a to-do list for Friday evening; I’ve got some dinner plans with my partner, but I figure after that we can stay in and watch a movie and I can work on some low-engagement tasks like documentation or fixing some tests.</p>


<p>…Wait, what? Obviously, that’s dumb.</p>


<p><strong>I’m pretty bad at working myself too hard, but I’ve grown better at catching myself when I do it.</strong></p>


<p>I ban myself from my laptop for the evening.  This is literal: I have a program on my laptop that bars me from access for a given period of time.  <a href="https://getcoldturkey.com/">It is fantastic.</a></p>


<p>Here’s how I spent my Friday night after a long week:</p>


<ol>
<li>I went for a long <a href="http://seattleboulderingproject.com">bouldering session</a> with my partner.</li>
<li>Then we ordered Chinese food delivery.</li>
<li>Then we spent two hours experimenting with new cocktails (we ended up really liking the <a href="https://getbarback.com/recipes/scottish-orchard/">Scottish Orchard</a>) and watching <em>Easy</em> on Netflix.</li>
<li>Then I played Overwatch for ninety minutes. I think I went 4-3.</li>
<li>Then I fell asleep, tipsy and drowsy.</li>
</ol>


<p>Honestly, this is an atypical Friday night!  I’m not wired to spend an entire night doing nothing super productive, and if I do it too often I feel just as gross as if I spend multiple consecutive nights working.  I’m aware that makes me weird; I’m mostly okay with it.</p>


<p>But long weeks deserve nights off.  I don’t want to spend every Friday night with my brain turned off — but sometimes you have to pull the levers that make you as productive as possible, and sometimes you have to push the levers back to where they used to be.</p>


<p>My goal is to not have long weeks.  There are things I could have done better — I could have lengthened the onboarding schedule for the new client, I could have not worried about the side project.  <strong>I need to do a better job of internalizing that work is just a thing that doesn’t deserve to bleed into other things</strong>.</p>


<p>I’m not quite there yet.  I’m getting there, though.  And in the meantime at least I know where my levers are.</p>
