<p>(Originally prompted by <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8938915">this HN thread</a>.  I didn’t get enough magical internet points to sate my positive feedback mechanisms, so I decided to elaborate a bit and post it here as well.)</p>


<p><strong>07.30 am</strong> → Alarm goes off.</p>


<p><strong>08.00 am</strong> → Wake up.</p>


<p><strong>08.15 am</strong> → Summon energy to make eggs, shower, etc.</p>


<p><strong>08.45 am</strong> → Listen to <a href="http://hypem.com/jmduke">hypem</a> and read personal emails/HN.</p>


<p><strong>09.00 am</strong> → Walk to work.</p>


<p><strong>09.15 am</strong> → Arrive at work. Check to see if someone brought in <a href="http://www.toppotdoughnuts.com/">Top Pot</a>.</p>


<p><strong>09.16 am</strong> → Brush donut crumbs off shirt. Grab coffee; check metrics dashboards, ticket queue, and internal news.</p>


<p><strong>09.30 am</strong> → Grab more coffee. Go through work emails and code reviews.</p>


<p><strong>10.30 am</strong> → Morning stand-up meeting.</p>


<p><strong>10.45 am</strong> → Code and achieve some pedestrian level of zen.</p>


<p><strong>11.30 am</strong> → Check to see if <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/tacos-el-tajin-algona">Tacos el Tajin</a> is here and if the line is short.</p>


<p><strong>11.35 am</strong> → Head somewhere else for lunch because the line for Tacos el Tajin is <em>never</em> short.</p>


<p><strong>11.45 am</strong> → Eat lunch at desk, watching an internal presentation or Coursera video <sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>


<p><strong>12.15 pm</strong> → Resume pedestrian level of zen.</p>


<p><strong>02.00 pm</strong> → Roll a d6. If &gt;3, continue programming. Otherwise, attending meetings for the next ninety minutes.</p>


<p><strong>02.19 pm</strong> → Grab more coffee.</p>


<p><strong>03.30 pm</strong> → Roll a d6. If &gt;4, continue programming. Otherwise, attend meetings for the next ninety minutes.</p>


<p><strong>05.00 pm</strong> → Wrap up for the day; make sure I didn’t miss any emails while I only had one cup of coffee in my system; check to see if there are any new CRs; follow up with anyone who I told myself I should follow up with. <sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>


<p><strong>05.10 pm</strong> → Head home.</p>


<p><strong>05.18 pm</strong> → Pass by Chipotle and have a meaningful and slightly existential struggle about whether or not I want a burrito bowl. <sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></p>


<p><strong>05.25 pm</strong> → Arrive home. Make dinner or eat aforementioned burrito bowl.</p>


<p><strong>06.00 pm</strong> → Engage in requisite amount of physical exertion; I try and run and lift twice a week each.</p>


<p><strong>06.45 pm</strong> → Watch an unhealthy amount of television (right now: The Wire) while doing something else similarly mindless (right now: <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=4&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0CDgQFjAD&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fitunes.apple.com%2Fus%2Fapp%2Fdesert-golfing%2Fid902062673%3Fmt%3D8&amp;ei=7_LDVMPrNNe0oQSz0oK4BQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNH6nQZRCdz_X-XPDz2l0KpK_leKcQ&amp;sig2=3gizJ-lmH9DkfIHdFr3HhA&amp;bvm=bv.84349003,d.cGU">Desert Golfing</a>.)</p>


<p><strong>08.45 pm</strong> → Take a bath. Seriously, if you have access to a bathtub and you’re not taking a regular bath, you’re missing out.</p>


<p><strong>09.15 pm</strong> → Head to Uptown Espresso and do something vaguely intellectual: this is generally either OSS, writing a blog post, or reading (right now: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Big-Sur-Jack-Kerouac-ebook/dp/B00601W8L2">Big Sur</a>).</p>


<p><strong>10.00 pm</strong> → Head home. Clean up my apartment and finish up vaguely intellectual activity.</p>


<p><strong>11.00 pm</strong> → Make a <a href="http://www.getbarback.com/recipe/Manhattan">Manhattan</a> (or have a Dogfish Brown Ale) and listen to jazz.</p>


<p><strong>11.30 pm</strong> → Nightly ritual jank; brush teeth, wash face, wear sweatpants. Set alarm for 7.30am.</p>


<p><strong>12.00 am</strong> → Go to bed.</p>


<p><strong>12.02 am</strong> → Guiltily browse Twitter on my phone for what seems like hours.</p>


<p><strong>12.15 am</strong> → Drift to sleep.</p>


<p>All in all: I get to walk to work, spent eight hours doing something I care about, and generally enjoy myself (as long as I don’t look at how much I spend at Chipotle each month.) I drink around four cups of coffee today, but I’m trying to cut down!</p>


<p>Life isn’t too complicated.</p>
