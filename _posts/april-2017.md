<p>Okay, so this is <em>comically</em> overdue.  This is for two reasons:</p>


<ul>
<li>Village Blacksmith has been on the back burner due to a mixture of existing project burnout and maniacal work on a new project (more on that in later.)</li>
<li>I’ve been traveling.  Richmond to Durham to Portland has taken away a lot of weekends, and I usually do this when I have an hour uninterrupted at a coffeeshop, which has been a rare occasion.</li>
</ul>


<p>Anyhoo.  Onto the goods.</p>


<h2 id="victories">Victories</h2>


<ol>
<li>Launched one of my two goals from last month – <a href="http://changelog.spoonbill.io/support-for-lists!-20146">lists for Spoonbill</a>!</li>
<li>Spoonbill continues to grow at an impressive clip relative to how much I’ve been marketing it: it’s a little shy of one thousand WAUs and over five hundred daily email opens, which I’m <em>thrilled</em> with given that I’ve done no marketing for it whatsoever.  It’s been gaining traction within the OSINT and journalism communities which, you know, makes sense.  I still need to find out ways to monetize it but I’m really happy that it’s growing the way it is.</li>
<li>Had a quick one-off consultation that I was really pleased with, both from a results standpoint (my advice helped, empirically and emphatically!) and a “huh, I really have value” standpoint.  Imposter syndrome is an albatross – I was talking with a friend about how I was disappointed  that app sales were low this month and they were like, uh, you make hundreds of dollars not doing anything? – but it’s nice to get little blips of validation that I’m a competent person (as long as you ignore the sweatpants.)</li>
</ol>


<h2 id="setbacks">Setbacks</h2>


<ol>
<li>Fatigue with current projects is real.  Didn’t touch Barback or any of my smaller apps; didn’t make progress on Very Cute; didn’t iterate that much on Spoonbill.  And it’s reflected in these numbers: there was a slight uptick in app sales but that’s basically noise.</li>
<li>I did an <strong>awful</strong> job of marketing lists for Spoonbill.  It’s being used by less than ten people.  This is something I need to focus on – I think if people are going to be power users of this tool, it’s going to come from lists – but I don’t know how to get started.  Or rather, I know how to get started, but it’s going to involve a lot of things I actively avoid doing.</li>
</ol>


<h2 id="what-s-next">What’s Next</h2>


<ol>
<li><a href="http://buttondown.email">Buttondown</a> is that aforementioned project that I’ve been working maniacally on.  I’ve been describing it as “TinyLetter, except better” to people, but a more apt description might be “newsletter software that doesn’t suck.”  It’s not quite MVP stage – if you sign up right now, you won’t see any error pages, but you’ll only be able to send emails to yourself – but me posting the link publicly is my stake that I’ll have it at MVP by the end of the month.</li>
<li>That’s it.  One deliverable.  (Streth goal here would be Very Cute, but I don’t see that happening in the next… twelve days?)</li>
</ol>
