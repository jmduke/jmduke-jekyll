Title: "Developer experience is the ball game"

<p>I’ve read two bad takes recently on how “faux native” technologies are considered harmful.</p>


<p>The first is alarmingly titled <a href="https://josephg.com/blog/electron-is-flash-for-the-desktop/">Electron is flash for the desktop</a>:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>Also all you web devs: Go learn C or Rust or something. Your program runs on a computer. Until you know how that computer works, you’re doomed. And until then get off my lawn shakes fist.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>The second, a little less insufferable, is about an <a href="https://blog.madebywindmill.com/an-ios-devs-experience-with-react-native-559275b5a4e8">iOS developer’s experience with React Native</a>:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>Chances are that your finished RN app is going to feel like a not-quite-native iOS app and a not-quite-native Android app. Some people will have a bigger problem with this than others and most users of the general population won’t notice. But you do risk losing platform specific niceties that users will notice.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>Both of these articles make some fair points, even if they’re not cogent overall.</p>


<p></p>


<p>They’re worth reading, and bring up objectively correct things, like the fact that Electron apps tend to be less machine-efficient and React Native has some eyes that can hamper overall user experience.</p>


<p>But they gloss over what feels obvious, time after time again:</p>


<p><strong>Developer experience is the strongest bellwether for success.  The ability to iterate quickly is incredibly difficult to outweigh.</strong></p>


<p>I’m not saying this is fair, or the best for users in the short term, or cosmically correct or whatever.</p>


<p>But there’s a difference between <em>What approach produces the best software for users?</em> and <em>What is the best approach for producing software for users?</em></p>


<p>Rather than a grumbling from a developer who has dipped their toes in the water of “faux native” development, I think the essay written by the folks at <a href="http://artsy.github.io/blog/2017/02/05/Retrospective-Swift-at-Artsy/">Artsy</a> does a great job explaining the myriad reasons why a JS-based approach beats out a native one:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>The JavaScript ecosystem cares about how someone using the tool will feel. This is a part of what separates the good from the great in the community. It’s not enough to just provide a great API, and comprehensive documentation but it should substantially improve the way you work.</p>
</blockquote>


<hr/>


<p>I’m looking at my Applications right now, and most the apps I use the most – Spotify, Slack, Nylas, VS Code – aren’t native apps.</p>


<p>There’s a reason for that, and it’s not <em>those developers are idiots who don’t care about their users.</em></p>
