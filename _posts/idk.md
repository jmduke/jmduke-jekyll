<p>As of this month I’ve worked for an entire year as a ‘real’ software developer.</p>


<p>I want to preface everything I’m about to say about it with these two quotes:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>The doorstep to the temple of wisdom is a knowledge of our own ignorance. ~ Benjamin Franklin</p>
<p>… as we know, there are known knowns; there are things that we know that we know. We also know there are known unknowns; that is to say we know there are some things we do not know. But there are also unknown unknowns, the ones we don’t know we don’t know. ~ Donald Rumsfeld <sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>


<p>As you might have guessed from the title, the subject of this essay is ignorance <sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>, and how to deal with it.</p>


<p>I don’t know where it started, but as a developer I’ve always felt embarassed to admit that I didn’t know something.  It was like admitting defeat: like there was some fact or concept that I hadn’t mastered, that my proficiency was somehow flawed.  I think a lot of this honestly came from how much time I spent talking with other programmers, either in real life or on the internet <sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> where revealing a chink in one’s intellectual armor somehow invited vitriol and pitchforks.</p>


<p>Obviously, ever since I started programming in any capacity, I am assaulted hourly with proof of my own lack of knowledge.  There are hundreds of easy coping mechanisms: fending off a conversation while you look for the answer online, rapidly changing the subject, glossing over your ignorance with lots of wishy-washy stuttering, or the worst ever – assuming that no, the other person is wrong.</p>


<p>But I think the single largest area of growth over these past twelve months – from which I’ve grown from a novice developer at a massive company surrounded by people way smarter than me to a journeyman developer at a massive company surrounded by people way smarter than me – is the ability and willingness to admit (both to myself and others) that I don’t know something.</p>


<hr/>


<p>I’m going to give a simple example:</p>


<p>When I first started at Amazon, one of my early tasks was to switch out one of our service handlers for something that used a different endpoint.  It was a pretty simple task – only a few actual lines of code were changing, and it was more about me getting familiarity for the specific package – except <em>I had no idea what the actual package was</em>.  Our team has around two dozen registered packages in Amazon’s central repository, and for the life of me I had no idea which was the one I was supposed to be looking at.</p>


<p>And of course, I couldn’t just ask my teammate which package they were talking about.  That would be admitting defeat; that would be admitting my own programming mortality.</p>


<p>So, I did what any nervous new hire would do: I spent four hours nervously checking out every possible package and scouring over it to see if it rang any bells.</p>


<hr/>


<p>Now, obviously I could – and should – have just asked someone where the relevant code was.  It would have taken them five seconds to answer; it would have been no big deal to any part involved.  But of course, in my foolish, pseudo-egotistical head, I couldn’t risk it.  I had, either consciously or unconsciously, spent so many years glorifying this idea of being a self-sufficient hacker who could solve any problem and answer any question, and to deny that dream would be devestating.</p>


<p>This foolishness is reminisicient of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning-Kruger_effect">Dunning-Kruger effect</a>.  To quote Wikipedia:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>The Dunning–Kruger effect is a cognitive bias manifesting in unskilled individuals suffering from illusory superiority, mistakenly rating their ability much higher than is accurate. This bias is attributed to a metacognitive inability of the unskilled to recognize their ineptitude.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>If I had to pick the biggest area of improvement I made as a developer, it was that I drastically lowered the inhibition I had when asking questions or admitting that I didn’t have the answers.  It feels incredibly freeing – instead of making development feel like an endless struggle to meet the insane standards I set for myself – but, more importantly, I’m learning more than ever from more people than ever.</p>


<hr/>


<p>There’s a part of my head whenever I sit down to write a post like this that asks, <em>Well, okay, but what do you want people to take away from this?</em>  And sometimes that answer is sort of weak; sometimes that answer doesn’t come at all, and I highlight everything and press delete.  But this time, that answer comes easy:</p>


<p><strong>Don’t be so afraid of admitting that you don’t know.  It makes life easier.</strong></p>
