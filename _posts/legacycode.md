<p>Craig Hockenberry tweeted about some stuff a couple nights ago:</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I’m back in Virginia for Thanksgiving and, on a lark, decided to start digging through my closet.  I found some old shirts and some bad fantasy novels and a couple floppy disks filled with some of my first programming:</p>


<ul>
<li>A Dreamweaver site I built for one of my work-in-progress “novels”</li>
<li>An RPG built in Visual Basic</li>
<li>A “guess your number” Java applet</li>
</ul>


<p>It was great to actually poke around these things (thanks to the equally old PC we have which still sports a floppy drive.)  I’m impressed, for instance, that my ability to give variables descriptive names was actually pretty strong for a middle schooler before I discovered the gospel of <code>var x</code> in high school. <sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>


<p>It felt like flipping through an old grade school yearbook.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/wong2">Wang Dàpéng</a> created <a href="http://first-commit.com/">a tool</a> that plucks your first commit from GitHub, a sort of programming <a href="http://timehop.com/">Timehop</a>.  It is delightful.</p>


<p>My first <a href="https://github.com/jmduke/vivi/commit/5cf02878f0f0626bef222df1e16321b858bc79e0">commit</a> is for a repository called <em>vivi</em>.  It’s the first steps towards a Python static-site generator, with a couple blog posts thrown in for good measure.  It features tabs in lieu of spaces, but the code is still pretty Pythonic beyond that.</p>


<p>More striking to me than the actual commit, though, was the time at which I wrote it: August of 2012, when I spent the summer in Seattle as an intern in the U District.</p>


<p>I didn’t have many pictures of that summer: it was a quiet and somewhat lonesome one.  But browsing through this repository, I remember so much — the long afternoons spent biking the Burke-Gilman trail, the evenings spent happily holing myself away with an IDE and Sinatra’s discography.  It makes me feel warm.</p>


<p>——</p>


<p>I spend a good chunk of my free time developing for iOS.  I like the platform; I like Swift; I don’t necessarily like Apple, but I think they make very nice products, and I generally enjoy the time I spend inside XCode.</p>


<p>The repository to which I’ve pushed the most commits is <a href="github.com/jmduke/Barback">Barback</a>, a Swift app.  Between Swift’s rapid evolution and my own rapid maturation as a mobile developer, the sense of legacy code nostalgia is compressed.  I look back at commits from a year ago and chuckle at my ignorance <sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>


<p>I worry, as Craig says above, that all of these artifacts will be rendered unretrievable.  Will I be able to compile Swift five years from now?  Will I be able to run this code on an iPhone five years from now?</p>


<p>The answer is probably no.</p>


<p>——</p>


<p>Programming is an important part of who I am.  I’ve spent more than half of my life developing things — for work, for fun, for the unmeasurable thrill of creation and discovery. Those artifacts are just as important as Instagram photos or grade-school yearbooks: they are reminders of who you were and where you’ve come from.</p>


<p>Old code is absolutely worth preserving.  (The ability to run it, too.)</p>


<p>Spend some time digging through the artifacts of your (recent or otherwise) youth.  You may be delighted with what you discover.</p>
