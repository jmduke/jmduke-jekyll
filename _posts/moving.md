<p>First, the all-too-common apology: sorry for not writing more.  There’s been a lot going on in 2015, and some new habits have displaced old ones – somewhere within that, my tradition of parking myself in “writing mode” on Sunday nights disappeared.  Which is, in of itself, a copout answer: a more accurate explanation would be that my creative energy has been more occupied with <a href="http://ambience.audio">other</a> <a href="http://getbarback.com">things</a>, and the things I can write that don’t require as much creative stamina don’t really strike the same chord that they used to.  <sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>


<p>But, as I write this, there are two things happening that always seem to get me in a writing mood:</p>


<ul>
<li>Being abroad <sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> and without internet.</li>
<li>Big ol’ changes in my day-to-day lifestyle.</li>
</ul>


<p>I’m moving next week, and I feel like I should be simultaneously making a bigger and smaller deal out of it.  Moving is one of those things that inherently <em>feels</em> big, right?  It’s that kind of thing that inspires a television montage; there’s some symbolism in moving past the place you spent so many hours in a day, there’s a rhythm of having the uber-stress of the actual move and then the relief of finding yourself in a new place.</p>


<p>The truth is, I don’t really think I’ll miss my apartment that much; I like it, but I like the new place more <sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>.</p>


<p>One thing is the rhythm that I’ve developed over the past two years in Belltown.  So many little pillars in my life will be going away: the block-away Uptown Espresso, the growler fills at <a href="http://jmduke.com/posts/vine-street-market/">Vine St. Market</a>, the tiny commute cutting through Denny Park, the cocktails at Clever Bottle and Bathtub Gin, the warmth.</p>


<p>I know these things will come back in time: I’ll eventually sync my sleep schedule with the eccentricities of the 8, I’ll find my favorite coffee and cocktail spots, I’ll train my muscle memory to stop typing in *500 Wall Street * in the shipping address.</p>


<p>I think the strongest memories I’ll have about my soon-to-be-old place, though, will be the ones that came by virtue of it being ~<em>~ my first place ~</em>~.  Things like finally having a place to call my apartment.  Setting off my fire alarm the first time I made pan-seared steak <sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>.  Hosting M for the first time (and discovering how to make a too-strong margarita.)  That grueling July afternoon where Dad and I assembled an entire apartment’s worth of IKEA furniture.  That hug goodbye.</p>


<p>Those memories, though, will always be strong.</p>


<hr/>


<p>I’ve been in my new place for almost a month, now, and it’s surprising to me the things that change and don’t change.</p>


<p>If I squint my eyes, I haven’t moved at all.  I’m still collapsed in the same red couch and fall asleep in the same gray bed.  I’ve got the same pots and pans and I listen to same Paul Simon albums while I cook breakfast for the week.  I still spend too much time on the Internet and too little time outside.  I still dribble my soccer ball around the dining room when I’m thinking.  It still takes some effort to leave work on a Thursday and not reflexively start heading to Denny Park; but even once I’m back home, it feels as if I’m back in Belltown, in the same place I’ve been for two years.</p>


<p>But there are the tiny changes to my habits that alert me otherwise. The cacophony of firetrucks and drunks from 2nd have been replaced with a calm hum.  The hardwood floors wake up my feet in the morning.  The water pressure from the kitchen sink is worse, and I need to use more elbow grease.  The bath takes longer to fill, but I wait fifteen minutes and feel like I could dive into it.  There’s a Trader Joe’s across the street that I shop at every day, instead of having to rent a Zipcar and stocking up every couple weeks.  I no longer have a schwarma place, but I have a Thai place.  The walk to work is longer, but I pick up coffee on the way.</p>


<p>Every other move except this one has been a “big move” – the move to Virginia, the move to college, the move after college, all massive changes in identity which happened to coincide with a move.  This wasn’t that – I’m still the same person with the same rhythm, just with some new fluctuations and background music.</p>
