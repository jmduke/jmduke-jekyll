<p>I used to work at Amazon.  When I worked at Amazon, I got to walk to work.  Walking to work is <em>amazing</em>.  I think it has spoiled me to the extent that I cannot imagine ever having a job which required commuting via car or public transit.</p>


<p>Now I work from home.  This is, in theory, an <em>even better commute</em> than being able to walk to work.  In fact, my walk to work is approximately ten seconds long.</p>


<p>Before I started working from home, I did a lot of research about how to handle it.  Most of what I read stressed the importance of constructing barriers between your office and your home:</p>


<ul>
<li>Only ever work from one place in the house;</li>
<li>Force yourself to dress up every day;</li>
<li>Establish routines and schedules.</li>
</ul>


<p>I disregarded most of these:</p>


<ul>
<li>I regularly work in sweatpants;</li>
<li>I work on my couch;</li>
<li>I’ll sit at my ‘office desk’ to watch football or drain my Pocket queue.</li>
</ul>


<p>I did take one piece of advice seriously, though — and I think it’s the main reason I’m in the best work environment of my entire life.</p>


<hr/>


<p>At the end of every day, I go for a walk.  I go for the same walk every day: 1.3 miles up 16th Avenue until I reach Louisa Boren Lookout Park.</p>


<p>It takes me around twenty-five minutes to reach the park.  On the way, sometimes I listen to heavy podcasts that require attention and consideration, when my brain is still hungry from the afternoon.</p>


<p>Sometimes, I listen to softer ones — weekly ones, things where I can zone out for a little bit.</p>


<p>On the really demanding days, I just listen to music and let my brain turn off completely.</p>


<p>The walk to the park is pleasant.  I see dogs.  I see the leaves change.  I see some neighbors.  Mostly I’m not paying attention — I feel on autopilot, commuting through Capitol Hill.</p>


<p>Then I reach the park.  The park is very good, though it’s less a ‘park’ and more ‘a couple of benches with a very nice view’.  Here is a picture of Louisa Boren Lookout Park:</p>

<p>Even when its dark or rainy out — which is often in Seattle at 6pm — you can make out Lake Washington, and the beautiful vista on the other shore.  The picture doesn’t do it justice; even one visit to the lookout doesn’t really do it justice.  The view from Louisa Boren is best appreciated like a really good album, where you have to give it listen after listen after listen to really appreciate what it’s offering you.</p>


<p>Then I walk back home.  Another twenty-five minutes listening to something of varying intensity. Sometimes my walk back is a little faster, sometimes it’s a little slower.</p>


<p>I get back home and I take my shoes off.  It feels good.  I make some dinner or pour a drink or take a bath.  I am now done for the day, and I can move onto more important things.  Whatever work was still on my mind at the beginning of the walk has vanished until morning.</p>


<hr/>


<p>My vision of working from home was originally renegade and chaotic: afternoons spent in bars and coffeeshops.  <em>Freedom</em> was the operative word: freedom to work whenever and wherever and however.</p>


<p>Now that I have that freedom, I realize the importance of routines and constraints by which I can mentally organize my day.</p>


<p>My walk home lets me be a little more mechanical — which lets me be a little less mechanical.  For that, I am very grateful.</p>
