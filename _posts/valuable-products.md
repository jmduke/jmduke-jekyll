<p>Jakob Egger, who created a number of great apps that I use daily (like <a href="http://postgresapp.com">Postgres.app</a> and <a href="https://eggerapps.at/postico/">Postico</a> wrote a post entitled <a href="https://jakobegger.at/2016/04/06/subscription-pricing-is-for-stagnating-products/">Subscription Pricing is for Stagnating Products</a>:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>The one thing I don’t understand is why smaller companies are also trying to switch to subscriptions? Are they also suffering from a stagnating user base, and hoping to increase their bottom line? If that is the case, they are doomed — subscription pricing will only diminish their user base even faster, and won’t fix the underlying problems that led to a lack of growth in the first place.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>It’s easy to see where Jakob is coming from: he’s done very well with his paid up-front model for his apps.</p>


<p>However, Jakob’s (much deserved!) success in his pricing model does not translate to definitive proof that paid up-front apps are the way to go.</p>


<p>Instead, subscription models, while not necessarily <em>absolutely better</em>, are a worthwhile strategy in terms of maximizing the amount of value you capture from a customer.</p>


<p>Let’s say there’s an app that costs $50 that I can use to debug and profile database queries. I’m a backend programmer who values his time at $200/hour. As soon as that app saves me fifteen minutes in time, it’s earned its keep. If that app saves me fifteen minutes once a week for a year, it has provided $2,600 in value. If I were to pay $20/month for that app, it would have still delivered ten times more value than I spent on it.</p>


<p>The obvious caveat here is that sometimes, your software’s value proposition doesn’t match that — maybe its something you only use once or twice a year, or something with obvious market substitutes, or something that doesn’t provide obvious value. And in those cases, sure, you shouldn’t use subscription pricing.</p>


<p>Ultimately, you should price your product with the goal of minimizing <code>amount_customer_is_willing_to_pay - amount_customer_spends_on_software</code> while understanding that <code>amount_customer_is_willing_to_pay</code> maps closely, but not identically, to <code>amount_of_value_generated_by_software</code>.</p>


<p>Sometimes, for things like a floor plan generator, the value generated is fairly static — I buy the app, I use it once or twice, and I don’t need to use it again.</p>


<p>But if your app is saving me, say, an hour of a time a week, that’s a tremendous amount of value that isn’t necessarily captured in a $39.99 price tag. And as a consumer, I’m grateful! But I’d still be grateful if I was paying $10/month for the same thing, because I’m getting <em>way</em> more than that out of it.</p>
