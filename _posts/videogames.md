<p>Like most of you, I used to be into video games as a kid.</p>


<p>There was the requisite Warcraft and Starcraft in high school, often squirreled away between Science Fair deliverables and assigned reading chapters.  There was Halo 2 in middle school. Before that, it was the standard list of SNES games — Chrono Trigger, Final Fantasy <sup>3</sup>⁄<sub>6</sub>, Super Mario World/RPG — that I think most white suburban programmers my age fell in love with.  I played almost all of them; I only beat a few, most victories falling victim to my short attention span.  (Why finish this game when there’s a new one to try out?)</p>


<p>When I was a kid, I was able to teleport into 2300 A.D., Ivalice, the Mushroom Kingdom, wherever, and to leave everything behind: taxes, homework, obligations, guilt, earthly desires.</p>


<p>And then — I’d jolt back into reality, having discovered I spent an afternoon tethered to my controller.  It wasn’t a big deal, then, to waste time like that.  I had homework, and chores, and then what?  I mean, I was a white dude in a neighborhood called <em>Barrington</em> — there were no legitimate stressors in my life.  It was simpler times.</p>


<p>Flash forward half a decade, though, and things are different. I don’t play that many video games, beyond the requisite amounts of FIFA. Still, being an adult is great.  (It feels a little embarassing typing that out, as if I’m trying to convince myself.)</p>


<p>Nowadays, it’s hard to actually sit down and play games.  There’s just too much <em>weight</em>. I spend an hour playing the new Final Fantasy and the back of my head is screaming about how much paperwork I could have gotten done or how more <em>truly</em> rewarding fixing that squeaky drawer would be or what the hell am I doing playing a PlayStation, I haven’t been to a doctor in eighteen months!  There’s no sense of absorption: even if I wander into a new world, one of my feet will stay firmly planted in Seattle.</p>


<p>The thing I miss about video games — about youth — is the ability to defy gravity.  When I was a kid, I fantasized about being a grown up with a disposable income who can buy all the games he wants and stay up all night playing them: I’m an adult now, and I can do that, and it just feels hollow and unrewarding.</p>


<p>I realize this is not entirely a “video game” thing so much as it is a media thing.  My imagination used to be this thing that was desperate to escape and fill up any container it came across, and now it’s more along the lines of a molasses reluctant to leave the confines of its tastefully decorated studio apartment.</p>


<p>My imagination just doesn’t get captured the way it used to. Maybe its the other way alone: maybe it’s my fault, for letting the muscle of my imagination to atrophy and wither away while I focus on things like refactoring and invoices.</p>


<p>The solution, then, is to find new things and hobbies to fit that gap, to figure out ways to indulge in a little escapism.  Side projects help — especially ones that I know will never see the light of day.</p>


<p>But still, I’m worried: the days I spend completely lost from the world, are they gone forever?  Do I ever get those back?</p>
