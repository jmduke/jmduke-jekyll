<p>I have an awful confession: I don’t really care about buying local.</p>


<p>Like, I think buying local is great in an abstract sense – objectively, the cup of coffee or growler of beer or whatever I’m spending money on has a lot more impact when it’s going to a company that’s staffed by a couple dozen people, let alone a couple dozen people that that are in the same city as me.</p>


<p>But it’s never really something that explicitly goes into my decision-making.  Like I’ll buy Seattle microbrews if they’re delicious <sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> and I’ll grab my morning caffeine drip from Uptown Espresso if the line on the way to work is reasonable, but I still spend an inordinate amount of money on the Pabsts, Starbucks <sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>, and Chipotles of the world.  There’s nothing exactly artisanal about these choices – I find them good enough, though, and consistent, especially compared to some local choices.</p>


<p>There’s one exception I make here, though, and that’s <strong>Vine Street Market</strong>.</p>


<p>Vine Street Market is a beer shop the size of a somewhat large closet on the corner of 5th and Vine, right across the street from my apartment.  I discovered it by accident: I wanted to grab a six-pack and my bodega closed early for the day, so Google Maps sent me there.  (Previously I thought it was a coffee-shop.  I was mistaken.)  Seriously – not counting shelving, this place is maybe a hundred square feet max.  The space allotted of beer outnumbers the amount of space not allotted for beer.</p>


<p>Every time I’ve stopped by, there’s been a maximum of one or two other people there: which makes sense partly because, as far as I can tell, it’s pretty much hidden from the public eye, and also there is only room to fit maybe six people max.</p>


<p>The owner, Jae, is perhaps the kindest and most cheerful person I have ever met.  I honestly can’t tell whether or not she actually recognizes me (I’ve been there enough that it’s probably the former), but every time I visit she greets me with the sweetest recitation of <em>Hello, neighbor!</em> that I’ve ever heard.  The woman has a straight-up encyclopedic knowledge of her wares – describe a taste or a beer you like and she’ll either recommend a half-dozen similar beers or offer to order one.</p>


<p>And, of course, the selection is excellent; there’s a great distribution of PNW microbrews and out-of-state staples, plus a wonderfully curated rotation of kegs on tap.  (She’ll let you have all the keg samples you want.)</p>


<p>The place has its downsides: the non-keg prices are higher than other stores around the area, and none of the bottles are refrigerated (to cut down on costs).  But even though I could go a block away and get my Old Rasputin fix for a buck cheaper, I keep coming back to Vine Street Market.</p>


<p>Why?  I’m not sure, and that’s probably the reason I’m writing this as a blog post and not as the most saccharine Yelp review of all time.  When I started this, in my mind it was a thesis about the inherent value of <em>buying local</em> when those local experiences are more personal and magical than the mainstream alternative.  Or maybe a sheepish admission that I’m tailoring my life to be as Wes Anderson-esque as possible <sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>, either subconsciously or consciously.</p>


<p>But, I mean, I’m trying <em>very hard</em> to become the kind of person who stops assigning undue amounts of profundity to the place I buy my stouts.  I shop at Vine Street Market because it makes me happy.  (You should, too – at least, if you’re in Seattle.)</p>
