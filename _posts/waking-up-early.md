<p>Ever since I got back to Seattle after Christmas, I’ve been waking up early.</p>


<p>Not, like, <em>super</em> early, but 6-6.30 am.  This is a big deal for me; I’ve never been able to really drag myself out of bed until around 8 or so.</p>


<p>But suddenly (probably thanks to jet lag) it started clicking.  <sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>


<p>I’ve settled into a little routine: wake up at around 6am, set up the coffee machine while I jump in the shower, then spend until 7am catching up on emails and reading.  I work on freelance or side projects until 8, at which point I either go to the gym or write for an hour.  By 9am I’m back at my desk, with breakfast (a smoothie or a protein bar because I’m still lazy) and I feel like I’ve accomplished a half a day’s worth of stuff already.</p>


<p></p>


<p>I’ve always loved the idea of being a morning person, but was never able to make the switch. For me, being a morning person was dichotomous with being a night person, and I <em>cherished</em> being a night person.  I was my most creative, relaxed, and productive self at night.</p>


<p>And, you know what?  I still think that’s a little bit true. It’s weird to have your day be over at 9 or 10.  8pm used to mean that I had a couple solid more hours of life and ability before I needed to think of winding down: now, 8pm means that I have to finish up what I’m doing.</p>


<p>I also get <em>exhausted</em> in the evenings.  When I used to wake up at 8am, the end of the workday was basically a halfway point: I’d go for a walk, make some dinner, and still have a bunch of energy to do whatever I wanted with the remaining night.  Now, by the time I go for a walk and make dinner and take a bath and hang out for a little I’ve pretty much spent all the energy I have for the day.</p>


<p>But even with all of those drawbacks: this is the first time in my life I’ve been <em>excited</em> to get up in the mornings.  Falling asleep used to mean putting away whatever I was doing: now, it means getting myself ready for another awesome day.  Yes, it’s a silly and largely arbitrary distinction – the number of hours in the day aren’t changing – but it’s improved my outlook nonetheless.</p>


<p>I don’t want this essay to be prescriptive, because I’m not sure how universalizable my methods are and the biggest hurdle most people face (committing to waking up early) sort of just <em>happened</em>, so I can’t offer any actionable advice.</p>


<p>So if I have general advice, it is this: <strong>find the times and places where your world is calm and crystalline, and build around them.</strong></p>

<li id="fn:1">“Clicking” is perhaps not the right term.  Perhaps it would be more accurate to say “I stopped falling sleep at my desk.”
