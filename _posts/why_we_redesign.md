<p>If you are reading this — and have read things on this site in the past — you may notice that this site has a new design.  This is not particularly uncommon: I tend to mix it up every year or so.</p>


<p>Whenever I start to throw on a new coat of paint I ask myself two questions:</p>


<ul>
<li>What am I trying to show people?</li>
<li>Why should someone read me?</li>
</ul>


<p>The answers to these questions inform my design: what I need to include, what I need to emphasize, what I should write about, what posts I should keep around and what posts I should stop linking to.</p>


<h2 id="what-am-i-trying-to-show-people">What am I trying to show people?</h2>


<p>This is what I think of as the <code>index.html</code> part of the equation: what are you trying to tell people about yourself right off the bat?</p>


<ul>
<li>When I was a high school kid with a copy of Dreamweaver and a head full of mostly asinine aspirations about web design, I was focused on flash.  I discovered image maps in Fireworks; I played around with gradients and rollovers and all of those lovably silly hallmarks of 2005 web design.  The phrase “freelance web designer” was in my <code>h1</code> tag.</li>
<li>When I was a college sophomore who suddenly decided to pursue computer science, I suddenly became obsessed with credentialing.  I racked up a couple fun side projects and showed those: I listed my favorite programming languages (and movies and books, because I was still a pretentious liberal arts student.)</li>
<li>After I had a job, I wanted to establish myself as someone who had a certain level of expertise, so I started vomiting as many credentials as I could.  My job; my internships; my Coursera courses; my stars on GitHub.</li>
</ul>


<h2 id="why-should-someone-read-my-writing">Why should someone read my writing?</h2>


<p>If the home page of your blog is sort of the initial sales pitch – <em>this is who I am</em> – everything else is the innards, the <em>this is what I have to say and why I’m the one saying it</em>.</p>


<p>It’s always important to keep in mind who’s going to be reading your writing.  It doesn’t matter if it’s a blog post about concurrency in Python or a Slack message explaining how to start a database dump or a nervous request for a coffee date or an email asking for a raise.</p>


<p>If someone is reading something you wrote, they’re doing it for exactly one reason:</p>


<p><strong>They’re looking for an answer to a question</strong>.</p>


<ul>
<li>The question might be <em>how do I send an email in Python?</em></li>
<li>The question might be <em>why did my son get a tattoo?</em></li>
<li>The question might be implicit, like <em>should I hire this person?</em></li>
<li>The question might be something you posed in the title of your post.</li>
<li>The question might be completely irrelevant to the thing they’re actually reading.</li>
</ul>


<p>There’s always a question.</p>


<p>This leads me to the biggest single piece of advice I can give with regards to writing:</p>


<p><em>Figure out the question you want to answer.  Answer it to the best of your ability. Have the sharpest image possible of the typical person who has that question.</em></p>


<p>I used to think the third sentence – <em>who has this question?</em> – was the hardest part.  Lately, it’s been the first sentence – <em>what questions do I want to answer?</em></p>


<p>Thus the redesign.</p>


<h2 id="so">So…</h2>


<p>This brings me to this current iteration of the site.  I’m quite fond of it!</p>


<p>It’s a little more polished than its immediate predecessor: it has an actual biography, and a footer, and some basic analytics.</p>


<p>It doesn’t have share links.  It’s not particularly well-constructed with regards to SEO.  I don’t have a CV or resume or link to my GitHub.</p>


<p>It’s not written for anyone in particular.  I’m not actively looking for a new job, or new consulting work, or a larger internet presence.  It’s filled with stuff I’ve just kinda felt like writing.</p>


<p>The posts I’ve written over the past year or so are… not particularly actionable.  I’ve written about my birthdays and my love of Chipotle and my experiences travelling.  This is a blog in the more traditional, personal sense of the word.</p>


<p>Something like a journal.</p>


<p>This comes mostly from a place of privilege and comfort.  I’m no longer a college student who needs to demonstrate his programming acumen; I’m no longer someone who craves to see his TLD on Hacker News.</p>


<p>Without any specific audience in mind, I’m writing mostly for myself.  It’s insular and niche and overly solipsistic, but it also is the best writing I’ve done.</p>


<p>This blog might change, a year from now. (This blog will change, a year from now.) I might dive deeper into consulting and decide I want to focus on writing about that; I might ditch technical writing entirely.  It might become a photoblog dedicated to the corgi I’ll end up owning sooner or later.</p>


<p>But I’m happy with the little sliver of the internet I’ve carved out for myself, and I’m very happy to share it with you.</p>
