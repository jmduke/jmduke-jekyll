**Justin Duke**

Hello! I currently spend most of my time writing and thinking about software (vaguely in that order), 
mostly at [Stripe](https://stripe.com) and [Buttondown](https://buttondown.email).  I've been writing for around seven years now:
most of it is some combination of bad, uninteresting, and poorly aged.  (And yet I keep doing it, because it is very fun.)

I'm a big fan of JRPGs, cocktails, and the Miami Dolphins.  I live in Seattle where I try to enjoy the weather (or lack thereof).

I [love getting email](mailto:me@jmduke.com).
