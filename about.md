Hello! I work at <a href="http://stripe.com">Stripe</a>, making it easier for companies of all sizes to understand and improve their core operations.  Before that, I was the first technical hire at a commercial real estate startup and an engineer at Amazon making it more fun for you to read books on your Kindle. 

I created <a href="https://buttondown.email">Buttondown</a>, which is the best tool in the world for starting and running your newsletter.

I also created <a href="https://spoonbill.io">Spoonbill</a>, a social media metadata platform.

I <a href="mailto:me@jmduke.com">love getting email.</a>
