My current projects:

- [Buttondown](https://buttondown.email), the best way to start and grow your newsletter.
- [Spoonbill](https://spoonbill.io), a tool for tracking changes in Twitter profiles over time.

Some other, more random stuff I've built:

- [Ambience](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/your-ambience/id967898191?ls=1&mt=8), a background noise generator.
- [Barback](https://getbarback.com), the best cocktail database.
- [Cluebird](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/cluebird-crossword-helper/id1162829250?ls=1&mt=8), a comically bad crossword helper.
- [Floradora](http://floradora.cloud/), the easiest way to send yourself notes on the Mac.
- [Shotglass](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/shotglass-your-latest-screenshot/id1104711265?ls=1&mt=12), a tiny screenshot menu bar app.

Projects that, given infinite time, I would love to work on:

- Goodreads, _but better._
- A full-featured CSV explorer web app.
- Neural net-generated lo-fi beats.
